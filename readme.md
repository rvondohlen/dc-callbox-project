###Introduction
The District Callbox Project was initiated to map and document the remaining Police and Fire callboxes within the Washington, DC city limits.

###Implementation
Utilizes [Tileserver PHP](https://github.com/klokantech/tileserver-php) to serve map tiles made with [Tilemill](https://github.com/mapbox/tilemill) and exported using [MBUtil](https://github.com/mapbox/mbutil). Markers are recorded in GeoJSON and placed with [Mapbox.js](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox.js/). I'm currently using MAMP for a PHP friendly local environment and ~~Grunt~~ Gulp to compile the SCSS.

###To Do
- ~~Restyle map~~
- Add more boxes
- Add historical information on the page
- Add contact info to the page
- Potentially integrate photos of callboxes 
- Add functionality for users to add the boxes they've seen
